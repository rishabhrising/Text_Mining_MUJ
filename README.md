# Text_Mining_MUJ
 Notes and project on text mining {only fit for college exams }

**This personal journal serves as a repository of revision notes and materials for my college subject, text mining. Given the limited scope of my course, which primarily focuses on the “Course Handout” of my specific college, “MUJ,” I believe this resource may be beneficial to both myself and others in the future.**
